<p align="justify">
I am a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://cockrell.utexas.edu/research" rel="nofollow">University of Texas at Austin, ECE</a> starting from Sep. 2022. Pirior to UT, I earned my doctoral degree from Aalborg University, Denmark.
My research covers the areas of power electronics, electric power systems, and renewable energy systems.
Advanced Power Conversion and Control Research
My research is mainly funded by Department of Energy.

Power Electronics Enabling Clean Energy Conversion
------
<p align="justify">
We aim at developing innovative technologies to make electrical energy conversion more efficient, reliable and cost-effective. These technologies are used in a variety of applications, such as transforming raw and fluctuating energy from solar, wind and fuel cells into high-quality power required by end-users. Working with local and international organizations and industry partners, we focus on applying these technologies in hybrid and electric vehicles, industrial motor drives, renewable and distributed power generation, high-efficiency power supplies, and next generation smart grid systems.

Advanced Power Conversion and Control Research
------
<p align="justify">
Electronic power conditioning and control of the production and distribution are important aspects of the smart grid.
Grid-forming technology
I have worked persistently on issues relating to <i>Grid Modernization</i>,

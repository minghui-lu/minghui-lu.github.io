I am honored to be invited to give an online technical presentation at <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/" rel="nofollow">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)</a>. 
</p>

In this research presentation, we will show the architectural and algorithmic foundations to enable power electronics-based power systems that enable unlimited penetration of photovoltaic resources with grid-forming (GFM) inverters. Directives and portfolios targeting 100% renewable integration have already been instituted in various states, the District of Columbia, and in over 100 cities across the US. To usher in this new age, we will introduce the notion of a GFM inverter describe a power electronics interface that can help sustain system integrity via localized voltage and frequency regulation. Such a strategy also gives communication-free power sharing, synchronization, and an ultra-resilient decentralized architecture.
